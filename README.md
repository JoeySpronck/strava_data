### ðŸ“ˆ Weekly volume progression
###### Based on 10% rule. The next unreached target (this or next week) will be used as target for following plots

### Example Week Plans
###### These plots show examples of how a week could be divided into multiple runs, given the target mileage.

### Weekly Stacked Plots
###### Stacked barplots, showing run stacks for each week. 

#### Color = Risk 
###### Here risk is defined by combining distance from normal distribution. Faster and longer runs contribute to higher risk, slower and shorter to lower risk.
